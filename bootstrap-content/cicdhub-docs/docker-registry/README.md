# Docker Registry

A Docker Registry has been installed in the CICDHub, primarly for:

- hosting the Stratoss&trade; Lifecycle Manager docker images so they are available on AIO environments
- to host any VNFC images used by your VNFs

The Docker Registry can be accessed at: {{bgv_docker_registry_addr}}
